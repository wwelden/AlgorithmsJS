# AlgorithmsJS
Reviewing my algorithms notes and writing algorithms in JS to reinforce the concepts, also it's fun ðŸ¤©

Eventually I want to make a tool that calculates  the run time for eah algorithm.
I know JS isn't the best language for efficent algorithms, but I wanted to do this and I wanted to do something in JS so here we are.
